I ignored all the folders with non-binary files (i.e. the "manuscript" folder because of word docs, the "figures" folder because of .jpgs). I also ignored the user-specific R files. 

Not sure if I did the set-up of my repository correctly - I made one main repository for the two different branches of my project. Should I have set them up separately? Can re-do if needed!
